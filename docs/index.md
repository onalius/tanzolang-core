# TanzoLang Core

Welcome to the documentation for the TanzoLang Core project, which houses the open JSON-Schema specification, helper SDK stubs, and CLI tooling for the Tomodaichi Tanzo ecosystem.

## Overview

TanzoLang is a schema for defining and working with profile archetypes in the Tomodaichi Tanzo ecosystem. This repository provides the canonical schema definition, client libraries for working with TanzoLang documents, and CLI tools for validating and manipulating profiles.

## Key Components

- **Schema Specification**: The canonical JSON Schema definition for TanzoLang documents.
- **Python SDK**: A Pydantic-based library for working with TanzoLang profiles in Python.
- **TypeScript SDK**: A Zod-based library for working with TanzoLang profiles in TypeScript.
- **CLI Tool**: A command-line interface for validating, simulating, and exporting TanzoLang profiles.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide for instructions on installing and using the TanzoLang tools.

## Examples

The repository includes example TanzoLang profiles in the `examples/` directory:

- `Kai_profile.yaml`: A sample profile with multiple archetypes.
- `digital_archetype_only.yaml`: A simple profile with only a digital archetype.
