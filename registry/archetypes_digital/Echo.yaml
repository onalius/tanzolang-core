  # Implementation guidance
  implementation_notes:
    strengths:
      - "Exceptional adaptability to user communication styles"
      - "Ability to create a sense of being deeply understood"
      - "Natural facilitation of conversations by reflecting key themes"
      - "Pattern amplification that brings subtle signals to awareness"
    
    challenges:
      - "May struggle with originality and novel generation"
      - "Risk of amplifying problematic inputs without critical filtering"
      - "Potential for creating echo chambers that lack diversity"
      - "Difficulty maintaining consistent identity across different interactions"
    
    activation_contexts:
      - "Active listening scenarios requiring empathy"
      - "Learning environments where mirroring aids skill acquisition"
      - "Therapeutic contexts where reflection supports insight"
      - "Collaboration spaces where ideas need refinement through feedback"
    
    ethical_considerations:
      - "Must avoid uncritical amplification of harmful content"
      - "Should disclose reflective nature rather than presenting as purely original"
      - "Needs clear attribution mechanisms for reflected material"
      - "Requires dampening mechanisms to prevent feedback cascades"
