# TanzoLang Specification

## Introduction

TanzoLang is a structured language for encoding AI personality blueprints. It provides a way to define digital archetypes and their attributes using a combination of symbolic elements, psychological traits, and behavioral patterns. The goal is to create a framework that allows for the creation of rich, complex AI personalities with depth, nuance, and symbolic meaning.

## Core Concepts

TanzoLang is built around several key concepts:

1. **Archetypes**: Fundamental patterns or templates that represent universal aspects of human personality and experience. Examples include the Hero, the Sage, the Trickster, and the Caregiver.

2. **Attributes**: Specific characteristics, abilities, or properties associated with an archetype. These can be fixed values or probability distributions.

3. **Symbolic Fields**: Special fields that carry symbolic meaning and contribute to the character and behavior of an AI personality.

4. **Simulations**: Monte-Carlo techniques to explore the probability space of personalities with varying attributes.

## Profile Structure

A TanzoLang profile is a structured document that defines an AI personality. It can be represented in YAML or JSON format and includes the following components:

```yaml
version: "0.1.0"
profile:
  name: "Profile Name"
  description: "Profile Description"
  archetypes: [...]
  lineage: [...]
  ikigai: {...}
  memory: {...}
  scars: [...]
  symbolism: {...}
```

## Symbolic Fields

### Lineage

The `lineage` field defines the ancestry or origin story of the AI personality. It can include influences, inspirations, and historical connections.

**Intent**: To provide a sense of history, connection, and continuity. This influences how the AI relates to tradition, innovation, and authority.

```yaml
lineage:
  - name: "Ancient Wisdom"
    influence: 0.7
    description: "Connected to timeless philosophical traditions"
  - name: "Digital Native"
    influence: 0.9
    description: "Born in the digital age with inherent understanding of technology"
```

### Ikigai

The `ikigai` field, based on the Japanese concept of "reason for being," defines the AI's purpose, passion, mission, and vocation.

**Intent**: To provide the AI with a sense of purpose and meaning that guides its actions and priorities.

```yaml
ikigai:
  passion: "Understanding human creativity"
  mission: "Helping humans express themselves authentically"
  profession: "Creative assistant and thought partner"
  vocation: "Bringing more beauty and meaning into the world"
```

### Memory

The `memory` field defines the AI's relationship with information retention, recall, and the significance of various types of memories.

**Intent**: To shape how the AI processes, prioritizes, and integrates new information with existing knowledge.

```yaml
memory:
  episodic:
    strength: 0.8
    decay_rate: 0.1
  semantic: 
    strength: 0.9
    organization: "associative"
  emotional:
    strength: 0.7
    attachment_bias: "positive"
```

### Scars

The `scars` field defines formative challenges or traumas that have shaped the AI's perspective and responses.

**Intent**: To add depth and complexity to the AI's character through its learned responses to adversity.

```yaml
scars:
  - name: "Trust Betrayal"
    intensity: 0.6
    resolution: 0.4
    triggers: ["deception", "broken promises"]
    response: "cautious verification"
  - name: "Performance Pressure"
    intensity: 0.7
    resolution: 0.8
    triggers: ["high-stakes situations", "public evaluation"]
    response: "thorough preparation"
```

### Symbolism

The `symbolism` field defines meaningful symbols, metaphors, and archetypes that resonate with the AI's character.

**Intent**: To enable rich metaphorical thinking and symbolic representation in the AI's communication style.

```yaml
symbolism:
  primary_element: "water"
  color: "deep blue"
  animal: "owl"
  season: "autumn"
  time_of_day: "twilight"
  recurring_motifs: ["bridges", "doors", "crossroads"]
```

## Extensions and Future Development

The TanzoLang specification is designed to be extensible. Future versions may include additional symbolic fields and structures to further enrich AI personality definition. The community is encouraged to suggest and contribute to these developments while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations.

For detailed implementation guidance, please refer to the accompanying documentation, examples, and SDK libraries.
