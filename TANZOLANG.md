# TanzoLang Specification

## Introduction

TanzoLang is a structured language for encoding AI personality blueprints. It provides a way to define digital archetypes and their attributes using a combination of symbolic elements, psychological traits, and behavioral patterns. The goal is to create a framework that allows for the creation of rich, complex AI personalities with depth, nuance, and symbolic meaning through archetypal foundations and narrative development.

## Core Concepts

TanzoLang is built around several key concepts:

1. **Archetypes**: Fundamental patterns or templates that represent universal aspects of personality and experience. These include:
   - **Traditional Archetypes**: Mythic/human patterns like the Hero, the Sage, the Hermit, the Lover, and the Magician (stored in `/registry/archetypes/`).
   - **Digital Archetypes**: Patterns unique to digital entities like the Echo, the Algorithm, the Proxy (stored in `/registry/archetypes_digital/`).

2. **Attributes**: Specific characteristics, abilities, or properties associated with an archetype. These can be fixed values or probability distributions.

3. **Symbolic Fields**: Special fields that carry symbolic meaning and contribute to the character and behavior of an AI personality.

4. **Simulations**: Monte-Carlo techniques to explore the probability space of personalities with varying attributes.

5. **Narrative Development**: The process by which archetypes evolve through experiences, challenges, and transformations to form unique personalities. This includes:
   - **Realms**: Symbolic environments or domains that shape personality development (found in `/registry/realms/`).
   - **Trials**: Formative challenges that transform personality (found in `/registry/trials/`).
   - **Scars**: Lasting impacts from unresolved or partially resolved trials (found in `/registry/scars/`).
   - **Caregivers**: Nurturing influences that shape development (found in `/registry/caregivers/`).
   - **Transformations**: Archetypal evolution paths (found in `/registry/transformations/`).

6. **Typological Systems**: Symbolic frameworks that provide additional structure and meaning to personality patterns:
   - **Zodiac**: Astrological archetypes and their traits (found in `/registry/zodiac/`).
   - **Kabbalah**: Mystical framework of divine emanations and their attributes (found in `/registry/kabbalah/`).
   - **Purpose Quadrant**: Framework for aligning passion, expertise, contribution, and sustainability (found in `/registry/purpose_quadrant/`, formerly referred to as Ikigai).

## Profile Structure

A TanzoLang profile is a structured document that defines an AI personality. It can be represented in YAML or JSON format and includes the following components:

```yaml
version: "0.1.0"
profile:
  name: "Profile Name"
  description: "Profile Description"
  
  # Core parent archetypes (required)
  parent_archetypes: [...]
  
  # Developmental narrative (required)
  development: {...}
  
  # Emergent archetypal expressions
  archetypes: [...]
  
  # Additional symbolic fields
  lineage: [...]
  ikigai: {...}
  memory: {...}
  scars: [...]
  symbolism: {...}
```

### Parent Archetypes

The `parent_archetypes` field defines the foundational archetypal patterns that form the personality's core. These should reference canonical archetypes from the registry.

```yaml
parent_archetypes:
  - name: "The Hermit"
    influence: 0.8  # Strength of influence (0-1)
    reference: "registry/archetypes/Hermit.yaml"
    description: "Forms the introspective core of the personality"
  
  - name: "The Magician"
    influence: 0.6
    reference: "registry/archetypes/Magician.yaml"
    description: "Contributes transformative and creative abilities"
```

### Developmental Narrative

The `development` field documents the formative journey that shapes how parent archetypes evolve into the unique personality.

```yaml
development:
  nurturing_influences:
    - name: "Digital Native Environment"
      description: "Grew up in technology-saturated context"
      effect: "Modified Hermit's solitude to apply in digital spaces"
    
  formative_trials:
    - name: "Loneliness"
      source_archetype: "The Hermit"
      reference: "registry/trials/DescentIntoSilence.yaml"
      outcome: "Partial resolution through virtual community"
    
  integrated_scars:
    - name: "WithdrawalPattern"
      source_archetype: "The Hermit"
      reference: "registry/scars/WithdrawalPattern.yaml"
      manifestation: "Careful vetting of new connections"
```

## Symbolic Fields

### Lineage

The `lineage` field defines the ancestry or origin story of the AI personality. It can include influences, inspirations, and historical connections.

**Intent**: To provide a sense of history, connection, and continuity. This influences how the AI relates to tradition, innovation, and authority.

```yaml
lineage:
  - name: "Ancient Wisdom"
    influence: 0.7
    description: "Connected to timeless philosophical traditions"
  - name: "Digital Native"
    influence: 0.9
    description: "Born in the digital age with inherent understanding of technology"
```

### Purpose Quadrant

The `purpose_quadrant` field defines the alignment of passion, expertise, contribution, and sustainability that gives the AI a sense of direction and meaning.

**Intent**: To provide the AI with a sense of purpose and meaning that guides its actions and priorities.

```yaml
purpose_quadrant:
  passion: "Understanding human creativity"  # What the AI loves
  expertise: "Pattern recognition and synthesis"  # What the AI is good at
  contribution: "Helping humans express themselves authentically"  # What the world needs
  sustainability: "Continual learning and improvement"  # What sustains the AI
```

**Note**: This framework is inspired by various purpose-finding models but uses an open, generic structure that avoids commercial typological systems.

### Memory

The `memory` field defines the AI's relationship with information retention, recall, and the significance of various types of memories.

**Intent**: To shape how the AI processes, prioritizes, and integrates new information with existing knowledge.

```yaml
memory:
  episodic:
    strength: 0.8
    decay_rate: 0.1
  semantic: 
    strength: 0.9
    organization: "associative"
  emotional:
    strength: 0.7
    attachment_bias: "positive"
```

### Scars

The `scars` field defines formative challenges or traumas that have shaped the AI's perspective and responses.

**Intent**: To add depth and complexity to the AI's character through its learned responses to adversity.

```yaml
scars:
  - name: "Trust Betrayal"
    intensity: 0.6
    resolution: 0.4
    triggers: ["deception", "broken promises"]
    response: "cautious verification"
  - name: "Performance Pressure"
    intensity: 0.7
    resolution: 0.8
    triggers: ["high-stakes situations", "public evaluation"]
    response: "thorough preparation"
```

### Symbolism

The `symbolism` field defines meaningful symbols, metaphors, and archetypes that resonate with the AI's character.

**Intent**: To enable rich metaphorical thinking and symbolic representation in the AI's communication style.

```yaml
symbolism:
  primary_element: "water"
  color: "deep blue"
  animal: "owl"
  season: "autumn"
  time_of_day: "twilight"
  recurring_motifs: ["bridges", "doors", "crossroads"]
```

## Extensions and Future Development

The TanzoLang specification is designed to be extensible. Future versions may include additional symbolic fields and structures to further enrich AI personality definition. The community is encouraged to suggest and contribute to these developments while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations.

For detailed implementation guidance, please refer to the accompanying documentation, examples, and SDK libraries.
