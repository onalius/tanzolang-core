TanzoLang is the open schema specification for defining digital archetypes and their attributes in the Tomodaichi Tanzo ecosystem.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **JSON-Schema Specification**: Define archetypes and their attributes with strong validation
- **Probability Distributions**: Support for normal, uniform, and discrete distributions for simulation
- **Python SDK**: Pydantic-based models for type-safe manipulation
- **TypeScript SDK**: Zod-powered schema validation and type inference
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for validation, simulation, and export

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Python

```bash
pip install tanzo-schema
```

### For Developers

If you're developing TanzoLang Core or experiencing issues with binary dependencies (like NumPy), use the provided requirements template:

```bash
# Rename the template first
mv requirements_template.txt requirements.txt

# Install using pip with binary packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This approach ensures NumPy is installed as a binary wheel, avoiding compiler issues on systems without native build tools.
