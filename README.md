TanzoLang is the open schema specification for defining digital archetypes and their attributes in the Tomodaichi Tanzo ecosystem.

## üåü Features

- **JSON-Schema Specification**: Define archetypes and their attributes with strong validation
- **Probability Distributions**: Support for normal, uniform, and discrete distributions for simulation
- **Python SDK**: Pydantic-based models for type-safe manipulation
- **TypeScript SDK**: Zod-powered schema validation and type inference
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for validation, simulation, and export

## üì¶ Installation

### Python

```bash
pip install tanzo-schema
```

### üêç Manual Installation (if Poetry fails)

If Poetry isn't working or you're encountering compiler errors (like with NumPy), you can install manually with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -U pip
pip install numpy==1.26.4 --only-binary=:all:
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This approach ensures NumPy is installed as a binary wheel, avoiding compiler issues on systems without native build tools.
