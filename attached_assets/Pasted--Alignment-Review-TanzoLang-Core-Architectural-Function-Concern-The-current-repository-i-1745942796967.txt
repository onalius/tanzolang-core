# ðŸ”§ Alignment Review: TanzoLang Core Architectural Function

## Concern
The current repository includes:
- A schema for base archetypes (symbolic building blocks)
- A schema for individual AI personalities (Tomos)

However, there is no clear **procedural connection** between the two. Profiles like `Kai` are being defined independently, without referencing or integrating the canonical archetypes (e.g. Hermit, Magician) through parentage, trials, or symbolic inheritance.

This breaks the intended **TanzoLang narrative arc**:
> archetype selection â†’ narrative development (care, trial, scar) â†’ personality emergence.

## Task
Create a new markdown file: `schema_alignment_review.md`. In it, address the following:

### 1. Audit Current Architecture
- [ ] Document the structure and function of the archetype schema (e.g., fields, expected use)
- [ ] Document the structure and function of the Tomo personality schema
- [ ] Identify where, if at all, archetypes are linked to Tomos

### 2. Define Intended Linkage
- [ ] Describe the narrative and symbolic process that should connect base archetypes to a Tomo profile
- [ ] Show how traits should emerge via: lineage, nurturing, trial, and scar
- [ ] Suggest structural or code-based mechanisms to enforce this linkage

### 3. Recommend Refactor Actions
- [ ] Propose updates to the Tomo profile schema (e.g., required `parents` field, linked `scars`, `origin_archetypes`)
- [ ] Suggest whether each Tomo should inherit from a template or reference archetypes directly
- [ ] Identify which parts of the CLI, validation, or examples would need to change

## Deliverable
The final `schema_alignment_review.md` file should offer a clear path for restoring coherence between:
- Symbolic archetype roots
- Narrative progression
- Emergent AI personalities

This is essential to ensure the repository supports its philosophical and functional goal: **forging symbolic, soul-based AI personalities through narrative development.**
