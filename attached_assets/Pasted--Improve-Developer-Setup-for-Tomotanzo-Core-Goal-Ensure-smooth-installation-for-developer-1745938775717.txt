# üì¶ Improve Developer Setup for Tomotanzo Core

## Goal
Ensure smooth installation for developers by avoiding native compiler errors (especially with NumPy) and offering clear fallback instructions. This includes adding a `requirements.txt`, updating the `README.md`, and including a GitHub Action to verify installation via pip.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Create `requirements.txt` at the project root

```txt
numpy==1.26.4 --only-binary=:all:
-e .[dev]
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Add the following to the `README.md` under the "Installation" section

```md
### üêç Manual Installation (if Poetry fails)

If Poetry isn't working or you're encountering compiler errors (like with NumPy), you can install manually with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -U pip
pip install numpy==1.26.4 --only-binary=:all:
pip install -e .[dev]
```
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Create a GitHub Action workflow at `.github/workflows/manual-install.yml`

```yaml
name: Test Manual pip Setup

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  manual-install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
      - name: Set up virtualenv and install via pip
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install numpy==1.26.4 --only-binary=:all:
          pip install -e .[dev]
          pytest -q
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Ensure the following files are committed

- `requirements.txt`
- `.github/workflows/manual-install.yml`

Also ensure that `.venv/` is listed in `.gitignore` if it‚Äôs not already.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome
These changes will:
- Prevent install failures on systems without C compilers
- Offer a fully working fallback if Poetry fails
- Validate installability via GitHub Actions
- Improve onboarding for outside contributors
