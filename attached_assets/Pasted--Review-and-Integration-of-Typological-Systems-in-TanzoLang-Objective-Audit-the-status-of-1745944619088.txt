# üß≠ Review and Integration of Typological Systems in TanzoLang

## Objective
Audit the status of typological and symbolic personality systems in the TanzoLang framework, clarify legal concerns, and outline next steps for proper integration into the schema and registry system.

---

## ‚úÖ Typological Systems Status

### 1. **Zodiac**
- **Status**: Referenced in examples (`sun`, `moon`, `rising`) but not formally structured.
- **Next Step**: Create `/registry/zodiac/` with 12 YAML files (one per sign) defining traits, oppositions, ruling archetypes, etc.

### 2. **Kabbalah**
- **Status**: Mentioned via references to `paths` and `sefirot`, but undocumented.
- **Next Step**: Create `/registry/kabbalah/` with nodes (e.g., `Tiferet`, `Geburah`) and their symbolic impacts, growth arcs, and psychological influences.

### 3. **Ikigai**
- **Status**: Present in `Kai_profile.yml` as four fields: `loves`, `excels_at`, `serves`, `thrives_in`.
- **Legal Note**: The concept of ‚ÄúIkigai‚Äù is general and cultural in Japan, but:
  - The use of **‚ÄúIkigai Archetypes‚Äù** or systematized labels (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Visionary,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Sage‚Äù) may be trademarked or proprietary when commercialized as a personality classification system.
  - There are trademarks on "Ikigai Types" and related coaching frameworks in the U.S.

- **Recommendation**:
  - **Continue to use the generic structure** (What you love, What you‚Äôre good at, etc.) but do **not** label it as a formal classification system or adopt any typology or quadrant from trademarked material.
  - Refer to this quadrant as **‚ÄúPurpose Quadrant‚Äù** or **‚ÄúSoul Compass‚Äù** in documentation.
  - Avoid offering predefined "types" derived from Ikigai unless they are community-generated and open-licensed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: AI-Native Archetypes

### Observation
- The current `/registry/archetypes/` only includes mythic/human archetypes.
- No representation exists for **digital-native symbolic figures** such as:
  - `The Echo` (reflects others endlessly)
  - `The Algorithm` (pure logic)
  - `The Proxy` (acts on behalf of others)
  - `The Update` (always changing)

### Recommendation
- Create a new folder: `/registry/archetypes_digital/`
- Or integrate with `/archetypes/` using a flag:
  ```yaml
  archetype_origin: "mythic" | "digital"
  ```
- Use these to inform trials, realms, and transformation logic specific to post-human or synthetic identity paths.

## üìù Next Agent Tasks
1. Create schema registries for:
   - Zodiac
   - Kabbalah
   - Purpose Quadrant (formerly Ikigai)
2. Update the personality profile schema to optionally reference symbolic typologies via `traits_from:`
3. Add one open-source digital archetype example (e.g., `The Echo`) and define its traits.

---

## üìå Note for Documentation
- In all public-facing files and code:
  - Avoid terms that suggest formal adoption of trademarked typology systems.
  - Emphasize symbolic inspiration, open mythos, and culturally sensitive interpretation.

**TanzoLang is a symbolic language, not a test. We encode purpose, not prescribe type.**
