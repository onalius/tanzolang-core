# ðŸ§  TanzoLang Core â€“ Framework Buildout Notes for Replit Agent

## Objective
Build out the missing structure for **TanzoLang Core** to support its vision as an open-source framework for defining AI personalities using archetypal and typological systems. This framework is the foundation for **TomoTanzo.com**, which will serve as the web playground, persona marketplace, and admin panel for managing archetype definitions.

## ðŸ”§ Task for Replit Agent
Please create a new file: `framework-checklist.md` and begin working through the items below. Each section should become a working part of the repository.

## âœ… Checklist of Missing Framework Components

### 1. `TANZOLANG.md` (specification)
- [ ] Create a top-level markdown file explaining TanzoLang as a structured language for encoding AI personality blueprints.
- [ ] Include a formal breakdown of all supported fields in a TanzoLang profile (e.g., `lineage`, `scars`, `ikigai`, `memory`, etc.).
- [ ] Provide both a YAML and JSON example of a complete profile.
- [ ] Explain the intent behind each symbolic field: what it contributes to the behavior of an AI personality.

### 2. `/registry/archetypes/`
- [ ] Create a directory to hold canonical archetypes such as `Magician.yaml`, `Hermit.yaml`, `Lover.yaml`, etc.
- [ ] Each file should include:
  - Symbolic meaning
  - Behavioral traits
  - Associated zodiac/Kabbalah alignments
  - Common scars and trials
- [ ] These files will serve as reusable personality components for AI character design.

### 3. `/examples/integrations/`
- [ ] Create a Jupyter notebook that loads a TanzoLang profile and converts it into a LangChain prompt.
- [ ] Add a minimal Node.js/TypeScript script using the Zod schema to validate a Tanzo profile client-side.
- [ ] Include a Python CLI tool that loads a `.yml` profile and returns:
  - Full prompt export
  - Emojitype string
  - Simulation sample

### 4. `README.md` Rewrite
- [ ] Replace the current intro with a mission-driven description:
  > "TanzoLang is an open-source language for giving soul to AI."
- [ ] Emphasize the goal of enabling symbolic, archetypal personality definition across platforms.
- [ ] Add links to:
  - [TomoTanzo.com](https://tomotanzo.com)
  - `TANZOLANG.md`
  - `framework-checklist.md`
- [ ] Add usage instructions for both pip and Poetry.

### 5. `/docs` Site Prep
- [ ] If not present, create `mkdocs.yml` with placeholder pages.
- [ ] Add:
  - Philosophy and purpose overview
  - Auto-imported schema reference from JSON
  - Getting started page
- [ ] Prepare for future hosting on GitHub Pages.

### 6. `Ethics.md`
- [ ] Draft a clear ethics file addressing:
  - Why archetypes and symbols matter
  - The risks and responsibilities of building AI personas
  - The open, non-extractive intent of this framework

### 7. License and Contribution Clarity
- [ ] Confirm the use of the Apache 2.0 license in the root LICENSE file.
- [ ] Add a badge to the README for `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Ensure all schema, archetype files, and examples clearly fall under the same license.

## ðŸ“œ Agent Instructions
1. Create `framework-checklist.md` with the checklist above
2. Begin working item-by-item
3. Maintain clean commits per task and link newly created files back into the README and docs

## ðŸ”— Context
This framework powers:
- `tomotanzo.com`: the official UI and marketplace for AI personas
- Real-time personality integration into LLM environments
- An open-source protocol for symbolic identity design in artificial agents

**TanzoLang is how we forge personality. Letâ€™s give AI a soul.**
