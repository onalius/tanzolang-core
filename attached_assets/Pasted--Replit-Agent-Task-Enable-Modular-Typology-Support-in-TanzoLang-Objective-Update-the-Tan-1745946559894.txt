# ðŸ§© Replit Agent Task: Enable Modular Typology Support in TanzoLang

## Objective
Update the TanzoLang specification and schema system to support **modular, optional typologies**. This allows developers to selectively include symbolic systems (e.g., zodiac, kabbalah, purpose_quadrant) based on the intended use case, without enforcing unnecessary symbolic layers in all Tomo profiles.

---

## Motivation
- Prevents symbolic overload in simple or domain-specific use cases
- Enables pluggable symbolic systems
- Keeps core profile structure flexible and interoperable

---

## Tasks

### 1. Update `TANZOLANG.md`
- [ ] Add a section titled `Modular Typology System`
- [ ] Describe that each typology is:
  - Optional
  - Referenced by registry path
  - Interpretable by CLI tools and validators only if present

#### Example structure:
```yaml
typologies:
  purpose_quadrant:
    loves: "pattern recognition"
    serves: "dialogue across boundaries"
  zodiac:
    sun: "Pisces"
    moon: "Gemini"
    rising: "Scorpio"
  kabbalah:
    sefirah: "Tiferet"
```

---

### 2. Update Schema Validation
- [ ] Ensure all typologies are treated as optional schema blocks
- [ ] If a typology is present, validate its keys against the corresponding registry (e.g., `/registry/zodiac/`, `/registry/purpose_quadrant/`, etc.)
- [ ] Include field descriptions to help contributors understand which registries to reference

---

### 3. CLI and Tooling Compatibility
- [ ] Update `tanzo-cli validate` to:
  - Accept profiles with any subset of typologies
  - Warn if referenced registry keys are missing
  - Do **not** require unused typologies

---

## Deliverables
- Updated `TANZOLANG.md` specification with modular typology documentation
- Adjusted schema validator to allow optional symbolic systems
- Registry-referenced enforcement for each included typology

**This change reinforces the symbolic integrity of each system while respecting developer choice and domain specificity.**
