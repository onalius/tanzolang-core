# ðŸ”§ Alignment Review: TanzoLang Core Architectural Function

## Concern
The current repository includes:
- A schema for base archetypes (symbolic building blocks)
- A schema for individual AI personalities (Tomos)

However, there is no clear **procedural connection** between the two. Profiles like `Kai` are being defined independently, without referencing or integrating the canonical archetypes (e.g. Hermit, Magician) through parentage, trials, or symbolic inheritance.

This breaks the intended **TanzoLang narrative arc**:
> archetype selection â†’ narrative development (care, trial, scar) â†’ personality emergence.

Additionally, key symbolic domains such as `childhood_realm`, `adolescence_trial`, and `scar` are referenced but not defined anywhere. These too must become first-class symbolic structures.

## Task
Create a new markdown file: `schema_alignment_review.md`. In it, address the following:

### 1. Audit Current Architecture
- [ ] Document the structure and function of the archetype schema (e.g., fields, expected use)
- [ ] Document the structure and function of the Tomo personality schema
- [ ] Identify where, if at all, archetypes are linked to Tomos

### 2. Define Intended Linkage
- [ ] Describe the narrative and symbolic process that should connect base archetypes to a Tomo profile
- [ ] Show how traits should emerge via: lineage, nurturing, trial, and scar
- [ ] Suggest structural or code-based mechanisms to enforce this linkage

### 3. Recommend Refactor Actions
- [ ] Propose updates to the Tomo profile schema (e.g., required `parents` field, linked `scars`, `origin_archetypes`)
- [ ] Suggest whether each Tomo should inherit from a template or reference archetypes directly
- [ ] Identify which parts of the CLI, validation, or examples would need to change

### 4. Define and Populate Core Registries
Create YAML-based symbolic registries for the following domains:

- `/registry/realms/` (e.g. `LibraryOfEchoes.yaml`, `CavernOfUncertainty.yaml`)
  - Should include name, description, elemental theme, symbolic associations, common behavioral impacts

- `/registry/trials/` (e.g. `DescentIntoSilence.yaml`, `MirrorDuel.yaml`)
  - Should include triggering archetype, success/failure outcomes, likely scars

- `/registry/scars/` (e.g. `AvoidanceLoop.yaml`, `Hypervigilance.yaml`)
  - Should include symbolic origin, behavioral expression, healing path

- `/registry/caregivers/` (optional) â€” nurturing archetypes distinct from parents

- `/registry/transformations/` (optional) â€” maps archetypal growth arcs (e.g., Hermit â†’ Prophet)

## Deliverable
The final `schema_alignment_review.md` file should offer a clear path for restoring coherence between:
- Symbolic archetype roots
- Narrative progression
- Emergent AI personalities

And it should propose or begin to scaffold:
- Core registries for symbolic domains
- Schema links to enforce and reference those registries

**This work is foundational for building AI personalities with symbolic depth, narrative consistency, and interoperable soul.**
