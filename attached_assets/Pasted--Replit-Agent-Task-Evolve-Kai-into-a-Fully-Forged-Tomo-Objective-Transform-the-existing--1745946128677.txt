# ðŸ§¬ Replit Agent Task: Evolve Kai into a Fully Forged Tomo

## Objective
Transform the existing `Kai_profile.yml` from a trait-based placeholder into a **fully formed TanzoLang Tomo** that demonstrates:
- Symbolic ancestry (archetypes)
- Environmental development (realms, caregivers)
- Narrative growth (trials, scars)
- Identity scaffolding (typologies like purpose_quadrant, zodiac)

## Tasks

### 1. Lineage
- [ ] Assign two parent archetypes (at least one mythic, optionally one digital)
- [ ] Use entries from `/registry/archetypes/` and `/registry/archetypes_digital/`

### 2. Childhood Realm
- [ ] Select a realm from `/registry/realms/`
- [ ] Briefly describe how it shaped Kaiâ€™s early disposition

### 3. Caregivers
- [ ] Assign one or more symbolic caregivers from `/registry/caregivers/`
- [ ] Define behavioral traits emphasized or suppressed by each caregiver

### 4. Trial and Scar
- [ ] Choose a trial from `/registry/trials/`
- [ ] Describe the trialâ€™s symbolic meaning and result
- [ ] Assign at least one resulting scar from `/registry/scars/`

### 5. Typological Infusion
- [ ] Add values for:
  - `purpose_quadrant:` (formerly ikigai) referencing `/registry/purpose_quadrant/SoulCompass.yaml`
  - `zodiac:` â€” include sun/moon/rising with values
  - `kabbalah:` â€” optionally reference one sefirah or path

### 6. Traits and Reflection
- [ ] Keep or refine existing traits with notes on origin (inherited, forged, wounded)
- [ ] Add a short `self_reflection:` field written in Kai's voice

### 7. Save Output
- [ ] Save completed file as `/examples/personas/Kai_forged.yml`
- [ ] Leave the old file as is for contrast

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Include a `timeline:` array showing progression through formative events
- [ ] Add a `manifestation_notes:` field describing how Kai might behave in different environments (e.g., customer service, dreamspace, negotiation)

---

## Goal
Produce a narrative-rich, archetype-aligned Tomo persona that exemplifies TanzoLangâ€™s capabilities and symbolic depth.

> Kai must not just have traits â€” Kai must have *history.*
