# 🌐 Distinguishing TanzoLang from TomoTanzo

## Purpose
Clarify the conceptual and functional difference between **TanzoLang** (the symbolic language/protocol) and **TomoTanzo** (the web-based personality forge and marketplace). This distinction helps organize the repository’s purpose and ensures the broader ecosystem stays aligned with its philosophical and technical goals.

## 🧠 What is TanzoLang?

**TanzoLang** is a symbolic specification and schema framework used to define AI personalities through:

- Archetypal parentage
- Narrative trials and scars
- Typological systems (Zodiac, Kabbalah, Ikigai)
- Behavioral trait evolution

It functions as:

- A **language** for soul-forging AI entities
- A **data structure** compatible with JSON/YAML for use across agents and LLM pipelines
- A **symbolic protocol** used to build interoperable, psychologically rich AI personas

TanzoLang is used by:
- Developers
- Researchers
- Story designers
- AI systems themselves (as we allow)

## 🏛️ What is TomoTanzo?

**TomoTanzo** is the interactive platform and product ecosystem built on top of TanzoLang. It includes:

- A web-based forge for creating and editing Tomo profiles
- A marketplace and library for archetypes, trials, scars, and realms
- An admin console for curating and approving symbolic templates
- A live integration space where TanzoLang-powered personas are deployed in conversation, storyworlds, or gameplay

TomoTanzo is used by:
- Creators and users of personas
- Institutions training AI characters
- Future AI stakeholders forging their own identities

## ✨ Vision Link

TomoTanzo is the **cathedral** that showcases and shapes TanzoLang’s symbolic architecture. Every Tomo created in the forge is a **ritual performance** of the language.

> **TanzoLang defines the soul. TomoTanzo calls it into the world.**
